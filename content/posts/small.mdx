First of all, please note that English isn't my first language, not even my second. So, if you're here looking for *polished, high-level writing*, you might be disappointed. But I promise Iâ€™ll always try my best.

Iâ€™ll be using this space to share information on a wide range of topics that excite me, from tech, programming, machine learning, travel, and many more. Who knows? You might even find a 1,000-word essay about my girlfriendâ€”if I ever have one, of course! ðŸ˜„

I canâ€™t promise regular updates, but what I can promise is that whatever I share will be thoughtful, meaningful, and of high quality.

Thanks for visiting!
